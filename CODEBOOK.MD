Codebook for XYZ from “Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones (UCI-HAR) 
Dataset Version 1.0” report
===========

### Summary choices

The project description asked for selecting the mean and standard deviation variables from the UCI-HAR 
dataset. From all measured and derived variables, listed in the ‘feauters.txt’ file, only those were 
selected by the ‘run_analysis.R’ script that ends with either ‘mean()’ or ‘std()’. The result contains 79 
variables in combination with 6 activity and 30 subject that gives 180 observations on each variable.
